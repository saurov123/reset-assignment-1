    <h5>Today, 690 million people around the world will go to bed on an empty stomach. But your gift means that one less child will be at risk of starvation tonight.

        Whether you decide to make a one-off donation or set up a monthly gift, you can change a life forever today. Often, one meal at the right time will be enough to make a difference between life and death. </h5>

Every single day, WFP has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes ready to deliver the food you send. Because you can't go there and hand out the food yourself.
